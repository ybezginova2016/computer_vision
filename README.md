## Three CV Main Datasets

### 1) MNIST

#### MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology)
MNIST is one of the first famous datasets for classification.
10 years ago MNIST was used for testing new algorihms, however, since then neural networks have learnt to fit best, and now MNIST is only used for learning purposes and minor checks. 
- Each images is sized as 28х28 pixel.
- 60000 train images and 10000 validation images.

### 2) Fashion MNIST

Fashion MNIST looks similar to MNIST, and contains 60000 and 10000 images sized 28х28х1; on the pictures there are images of clothes.

### 3) CIFAR (Canadian Institute For Advanced Research)

#### CIFAR is a dataset with small colored images for classification problem. 
Dataset is presented into 2 versions: CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.

#### CIFAR-10:
- image size is 32х32х3;
- 50000 train images and 10000 test images, in total - 6000 images for each class.
